# Lucknow Metro Management Application

## Overview

The Lucknow Metro Management Application provides users with functionalities to:

- View a list of metro stations.
- Display the metro map.
- Calculate the shortest distance and time between two stations using Dijkstra's Algorithm.
- Explore routes using Breadth First Search (BFS) and Depth First Search (DFS).

The application is built in Java and uses various data structures and algorithms to ensure efficient performance.

## Features

- **Station Listing**: List all metro stations.
- **Metro Map**: Display a visual representation of the metro network.
- **Shortest Path Calculation**: Find the shortest path between stations using Dijkstra's Algorithm.
- **Route Exploration**: Use BFS and DFS to explore routes.

## Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
- Visual Studio Code (VS Code) with Java extensions installed

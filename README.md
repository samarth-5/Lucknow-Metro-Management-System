# Lucknow-Metro-Management-System
This system takes the Source station and Destination station from the user as inputs. This code can display the Metro-Stations, Metro-Map, Shortest Distance between two stations in terms of both time as well as distance. I have used Dijkstra's Algorithm, Breadth First Search(BFS) and Depth First Search (DFS).
